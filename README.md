# Abstract

Placer is my excuse to re-learn SQLite after having been away from it
for a few years. SQLite is a server-less database system that is featured
in Android and Apple phones and tablets, Windows 10 (so it is rumored),
and countless embedded system including some on which I have worked. I
am not a database person, but I very much appreciate the persistent data
management model offered by SQLite that is usable both from applications
and the command line.
